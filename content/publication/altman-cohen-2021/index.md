abstract: '
This study aims to measure diversity in scholarly journals’ editorial board structure and
characterize patterns of editorial diversity across types of journals. To accomplish these aims,
we integrate multiple sources of data at the journal and editor level to assemble a novel
database describing the composition of editors and editorial boards for more than six thousand
journals internationally, characterized by discipline, commercial publishing model, and research
transparency. We then apply name-based gender imputation, geo-entity extraction analysis, and
standardized dispersion measures to evaluate each group’s diversity. This analysis reveals that
editorial leadership is more homogenous than editorial boards, and that diversity across both
boards and leadership varies substantially (and robustly) across disciplines. Open-access
journals’ boards exhibit less gender diversity and more international diversity than their
closed-access counterparts. These results also suggest that open access, open science, and
diversity, and equity, and inclusion are not strongly correlated and thus require separate
measurements.
