abstract: '
In this white paper we look at the open data available on monograph publication, and use it to explore patterns and trends in open monograph publishing. This blog post takes the form of a guided, interactive, reproducible data analysis based on currently available public data. We aim for this exploration to inform libraries, publishers, and authors about the landscape, and prepare for future transitions to open access.
